						<p>Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words &#8220;costume play&#8221;, is an activity and performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character.<br />
<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/311/dA7BCH.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term &#8220;cosplay&#8221; applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject. Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, manga, television series, and video games. A rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since the 1990s has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan, as well as in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions, and today there are many dedicated conventions and competitions, as well as social networks, websites, and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities.</p>
