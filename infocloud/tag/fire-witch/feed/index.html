<p>Downloadable content (DLC) is additional content created for an already released video game, distributed through the Internet by the game&#8217;s publisher. It can either be added for no extra cost or it can be a form of video game monetization, enabling the publisher to gain additional revenue from a title after it has been purchased, often using some type of microtransaction system.</p>



<p>DLC can range from cosmetic content, such as skins, to new in-game content such as characters, levels, modes, and larger expansions that may contain a mix of such content as a continuation of the base game. In some games, multiple DLC (including future DLC not yet released) may be bundled as part of a &#8220;season pass&#8221;â€”typically at a discount in comparison to purchasing each DLC individually.</p>



<h3>Other Media</h3>



<p>While video games are the origins of downloadable content, with movies, books and music also becoming more popular in the digital sphere, experimental DLC has also been attempted. Amazon&#8217;s Kindle service for example allows updating ebooks, which allows authors to not only update and correct work, but also add content.</p>
