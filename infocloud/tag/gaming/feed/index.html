<p>Video game culture is a worldwide new media subculture formed by video games. As video games have exponentially increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant influence on popular culture. Video game culture has also evolved, hand in hand with internet culture and the increasing popularity of mobile games. Many people who play video games identify as gamers, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone passionate about it. As video games become more social with multiplayer and online capability, gamers find themselves in growing social networks. Playing video games can both be entertainment as well as competition, as the trend known as electronic sports has become more widely accepted.</p>



<h3>Online Gaming</h3>



<p>Online gaming has drastically increased the scope and size of video game culture. Online gaming grew out of games on bulletin board systems and on college mainframes from the 1970s and 1980s. MUDs offered multiplayer competition and cooperation but on a scope more geographically limited than on the internet. The internet allowed gamers from all over the world – not just within one country or state – to play games together with ease. With the advent of Cloud Gaming high-performance games can now be played from low-end client systems and even TVs.</p>

<p>One of the most groundbreaking titles in the history of online video games is Quake[citation needed], which offered the ability to play with sixteen and eventually up to thirty-two players simultaneously in a 3D world. Gamers quickly began to establish their organized groups, called clans. Clans established their own identities, their marketing, their form of internal organization, and even their looks. Some clans had friendly or hostile rivalries, and there were often clans who were allied with other clans. Clan interaction took place on both professionally set competition events, and during normal casual playing where several members of one clan would play on a public server. Clans would often do their recruiting this way; by noticing the best players on a particular server, they would send invitations for that player to either try out or accept membership in the clan.</p>

<p>An <strong>online streamer</strong>, also known as a <strong>live streamer</strong>, <strong>internet streamer</strong>, or <strong>streamer</strong>, is a person who broadcasts themself online through a live stream or pre-recorded video. The scope of online streamers has grown to include different genres ranging from playing video games, tutorials, or even solo chats.</p>



<h3>In Real Life</h3>



<p>While the majority of professional and part-time streamers play video games, many often do IRL (in real life) streams where they broadcast themselves going about their daily life. They often do various activities while reading tips and questions from their viewers. At first, many streaming sites prohibited non-gaming live streams as they thought it would harm the quality of the content on their sites but as the demand for more and more non-gaming related content grew, many streaming sites decided to offer IRL streams. These streams can range from answering questions in front of a computer, streaming from their phone while walking outside, or even doing tutorials. IRL streams have become more popular over the years as good alternatives to viewers who do not necessarily like to play video games.</p>

<p>A gamer (sometimes also called player or electronic athlete and eathlete) is a person who plays interactive games, especially video games, tabletop role-playing games, and skill-based card games, and who plays for usually long periods of time. Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term &#8220;gaming&#8221; can refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional and digital forms, through online gambling. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube or Twitch virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a profession for some. In April 2020, researchers found that top gamers shared the same mental toughness as olympian athletes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Downloadable content (DLC) is additional content created for an already released video game, distributed through the Internet by the game&#8217;s publisher. It can either be added for no extra cost or it can be a form of video game monetization, enabling the publisher to gain additional revenue from a title after it has been purchased, often using some type of microtransaction system.</p>



<p>DLC can range from cosmetic content, such as skins, to new in-game content such as characters, levels, modes, and larger expansions that may contain a mix of such content as a continuation of the base game. In some games, multiple DLC (including future DLC not yet released) may be bundled as part of a &#8220;season pass&#8221;—typically at a discount in comparison to purchasing each DLC individually.</p>



<h3>Other Media</h3>



<p>While video games are the origins of downloadable content, with movies, books and music also becoming more popular in the digital sphere, experimental DLC has also been attempted. Amazon&#8217;s Kindle service for example allows updating ebooks, which allows authors to not only update and correct work, but also add content.</p>

<p>Unboxing is the unpacking of products, especially high tech consumer products, where the process is captured on video and uploaded to the Internet. The item is then also explained in detail and also can sometimes be demonstrated as well.<br>Yahoo Tech places the first unboxing video to be for the Nokia E61 cellphone in 2006.. According to Google Trends, searches for the term &#8220;unboxing&#8221; began to surface in the final quarter of 2006. Early unboxing videos focused mainly either on gadgets or fashion items. However, once the trend took off, unboxing videos were available for, as Yahoo&#8217;s Deb Amien put it, &#8220;nearly every thing that is available for purchase.&#8221; By 2014 the popularity of the videos were such that some companies had been known to upload unboxing videos for their own products, whilst others sent products to uploaders for free.</p>



<p>Some consider the popularity of this practice is due to the ability of showing the product exactly for what it is without any adulteration advertisers usually make around the product. Being able to see what the customer is getting &#8220;can contribute to the decision process.&#8221; Some users have tried to make these unboxings more interesting by adding special effects or doing them in different ways, such as an underwater unboxing of a waterproof smartphone.</p>



<h3>Diamond Order Box</h3>



<p>The growth of E-commerce has also been a major factor contributing to the rise of unboxing. Direct-to-Consumer companies needed a way to better connect with their customers emotionally and create a positive buying experience. This has lead to many D2C companies investing in packaging design to serve as a marketing asset for their products. The more engaging and cool the packaging is, the more likely consumers will record unboxing videos of their product and ultimately drive more buyers to the company.</p>

<p>Packaging manufacturers are also increasingly aware of the role of &#8216;the unboxing trend&#8217; in their development, and are continually improving their technologies to meet the demand for higher quality printed packages. Boxes are no longer just a transportation tool &#8211; they are a valuable marketing billboard delivered right to the customers.</p>
