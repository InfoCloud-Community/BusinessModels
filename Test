Test #330133001
Component testing is also known as module and program testing. It finds the defects in the module and verifies the functioning of software. Component testing is done by the tester. Component testing may be done in isolation from rest of the system depending on the development life cycle model chosen for that particular application.
In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
System testing is testing conducted on a complete integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements. System testing takes, as its input, all of the integrated components that have passed integration testing. The purpose of integration testing is to detect any inconsistencies between the units that are integrated together 
Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. It occurs after unit testing and before validat…
System Testing:
System Testing is done to check whether the software or product meets the specified requirements or not. It is done by both testers and developers. It contains the Testings: System testing, Integration Testing. It is done through more positive and negative test cases.
Acceptance Testing:
Acceptance Testing is done after the system testing. It is used to check whether the software meets the customer requirements or not. Acceptance testing is used by testers, stakeholders as well as clients. It includes only Functional Testing and it contain two testing Alpha Testing and Beta Testing.
The main aim of this testing is to determine the working process of the system by satisfying the required specifications and it is acceptable for delivery. It is also known as End-User Testing. It also works under the Black Box Testing Method.
Decision Table Based Testing:
A decision table is also known as to Cause-Effect table. This software testing technique is used for functions which respond to a combination of inputs or events. For example, a submit button should be enabled if the user has entered all required fields.
Error Guessing
Error Guessing is a software testing technique based on guessing the error which can prevail in the code. The technique is heavily based on the experience where the test analysts use their experience to guess the problematic part of the testing application. Hence, the test analysts must be skilled and experienced for better error guessing.

The technique counts a list of possible errors or error-prone situations. Then tester writes a test case to expose those errors. To design test cases based on this software testing technique, the analyst can use the past experiences to identify the conditions.
